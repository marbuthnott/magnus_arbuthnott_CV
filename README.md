**Introduction**

Analytically minded and solution driven Developer with over five years' experience within the Armed Forces.

**Background**

After graduating from the University of Leeds with a degree in Civil Engineering, I spent a year at Sandhurst before taking up various team lead positions over the course of four further years in the Army. Between leaving and now I have worked as a business development intern at a flourishing RegTech consultancy and have attended the AWS veterans re:Start program, with the focus of moving veterans into tech.

**Aspirations**

I am looking for a customer focused role where I can pursue the technical skills I have gained at Makers Academy and continue to gain exposure to customer success and business strategy.

## Notable Skills & Achievements

**Communication: Teamwork to operationalise technology**
- One of the core skills I have developed over the course of my career has been my ability to work with talented teams to operationalise technology. I have worked alongside companies such as Saab Group Defence, Security and BAE Systems to design and run multiple training scenarios, and have successfully implemented technology upgrades to run effective communication channels within a 90-person organisation.
- 5 months work in a business development capacity for a fledgling FinTech consultancy with the aim of bringing SaaS platforms and the financial world together. Successfully onboarded 2 regulatory platforms and qualified 3 commercial banks as prospects.

**Analytical & Solutions Orientated**
- The focal point of my career has been my ability to architect solutions to complex problems and is now the driving force behind my pursuit of a career in software engineering.
- Improved senior stakeholders ability to plan and synchronise multiple events and facilitated a 20% increase in career course attendance by identifying areas of weakness and implementing change within the digital planning processes of a 90-person organisation.
- Over 4 years planned and delivered a number of brand promotion events for the Scots Guards and redefined their 3 week summer recruitment drive, resulting in a 30% increase in potential recruit sign-up.

**Relationship Management**
- Empathetic people management was crucial to my success in the British Army.
- Managed a 30-person platoon over my first two years and worked with a variety of senior managers in a number of demanding situations over the remainder, in particular, US and Canadian Forces, the Royal Army of Oman, and the Kenyan Defence Force.

**Agile Project Execution and Delivery**
- The majority of my military career has been centered around the foundations of the Agile framework, and having now had a formal introduction to it I am keen to apply it alongside all I have learnt over 5 years of people and project management in the military.
- Led an 8-person team to plan and deliver an 8-month project to train 440 people for operations in Eastern Europe. The project centered around the host government's changing needs and translating those requirements into a human perspective which we could implement on the ground. The soldiers successfully deployed and gained international recognition for their work with Estonian Forces.
