**Introduction**

Analytically minded and solution driven Junior Developer with over five years' experience within the Armed Forces.

**Background**

After graduating from the University of Leeds with a degree in Civil Engineering, I spent a year at Sandhurst before taking up various team lead positions over the course of four further years in the Army. Between leaving and now I have worked as a business development intern at a flourishing RegTech consultancy and have attended the AWS veterans re:Start program, focused on moving veterans into tech.

**Aspirations**

I am looking for a role where I can pursue the technical skills I have gained at Makers Academy, consolidate my programming knowledge, and gain exposure to product management and business strategy.
